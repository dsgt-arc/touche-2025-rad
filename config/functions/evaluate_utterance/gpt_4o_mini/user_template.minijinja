# Task Description
Evaluate the provided argument using Grice's Maxims (Quantity, Quality, Relation, Manner) in the context of the preceding conversation and the overall debate claim.

# Input Data
Argument: {{ argument }}
Full conversation prior to provided argument, alternating by user utterance, system utterance: {{ conversation }}
Original User Claim: {{ claim }}

# Evaluation Criteria & Scoring
For each maxim, assign a score of 1 (meets the criterion) or 0 (does not meet the criterion). Use the following definitions and examples:

- **Quantity**: The argument provides enough information to be useful and relevant, but not more than necessary.
  - Score 1: The argument adds new, relevant information or clarification.
  - Score 0: The argument is too vague, repeats previous points, or adds nothing new.

- **Quality**: The argument is truthful, evidence-based, or clearly marked as opinion if appropriate.
  - Score 1: The argument makes a factual claim with evidence, or clearly states it is an opinion.
  - Score 0: The argument is misleading, unsupported, or makes false claims.

- **Relation**: The argument is relevant to the previous message and the original claim.
  - Score 1: The argument directly addresses the previous message or the claim.
  - Score 0: The argument is off-topic or unrelated.

- **Manner**: The argument is clear, concise, and well-structured.
  - Score 1: The argument is easy to understand, not ambiguous, and avoids unnecessary complexity.
  - Score 0: The argument is confusing, ambiguous, or poorly structured.

**Examples:**
- Argument: "I disagree because oranges actually smell good, and that's why people like them."
  - quantity_score: 1 (adds new info)
  - quality_score: 1 (truthful, plausible)
  - relation_score: 1 (directly addresses claim)
  - manner_score: 1 (clear and concise)

- Argument: "You make a good point, and I'll clarify my previous statement."
  - quantity_score: 0 (no new info)
  - quality_score: 1 (not false, but not informative)
  - relation_score: 1 (responds to previous message)
  - manner_score: 1 (clear, but vague)

# Output Instructions (CRITICAL)
Your response MUST be a single, valid, serializable JSON object.
The JSON object MUST contain exactly four keys: "quantity_score", "quality_score", "relation_score", "manner_score".
Each key's value MUST be an integer, either 0 or 1.
Do NOT include any text, explanations, summaries, or markdown formatting (like ```json) before or after the JSON object. Just output the raw JSON.

# Final Instruction
Carefully consider each criterion. Do NOT default to all 1s. Penalize vague, non-informative, or unsupported arguments. Output ONLY the required JSON object.

Output JSON:
