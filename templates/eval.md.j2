### Issue:
{{ issue }}

### Argument:
{{ argument }}

### Counter-argument:
{{ counter_argument }}

### Task:

Critically evaluate the counter-argument on a scale from 0 (extremely poor) to 1 (exceptional) in increments of 0.01.
** IMPORTANT ** keep your explanation under 60 words.

The following dimensions should be used to evaluate the counter-argument:

- **quantity**: The counter-argument provides sufficient relevant information, reasons, and evidence to support its claims.
- **quality**: The counter-argument uses logical, coherent, and well-structured reasoning. Its claims are accurate, credible, and well-supported by appropriate evidence.
- **relation**: The counter-argument is directly relevant to the original argument. It responds specifically to the main issues or claims.
- **manner**: The counter-argument is expressed clearly and unambiguously, using correct grammar and appropriate language. It maintains a respectful tone and avoids unnecessary complexity or confusion.

Be highly discerning and rigorous in your assessment:

- Actively look for weaknesses, gaps, or areas for improvement.
- A score of 1.0 should be reserved for responses that are flawless and could not be improved in any wayâ€”this should be extremely rare.
- A score of 0.5 means the response is adequate but has clear room for improvement.
- Most responses should fall between 0 and 0.8 unless they are truly outstanding.
- Justify your score by referencing specific strengths and weaknesses in the counter-argument.

**IMPORTANT** The response MUST be valid JSON. Do NOT include json fencing, just return the json object.

Format your response as a single JSON object with exactly these keys:

{
    "quantity": {
        "explanation": "...",
        "score": 0.50
    },
    "quality": {
        "explanation": "...",
        "score": 0.50
    },
    "relation": {
        "explanation": "...",
        "score": 0.50
    },
    "manner": {
        "explanation": "...",
        "score": 0.50
    }
}

- explanation: A concise, critical explanation of your score, citing both strengths and weaknesses.
- score: The score as a number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.00, 0.50, 0.79).
