### Issue:
{{ issue }}

### Argument:
{{ argument }}

### Counter-argument:
{{ counter_argument }}

### Definition of {{ dimension_name }}:
{{ dimension_definition }}

### Task:
Critically evaluate the {{ dimension_name }} of the counter-argument on a scale from 0 (extremely poor) to 1 (exceptional), using increments of 0.01.

Be highly discerning and rigorous in your assessment:
- Actively look for weaknesses, gaps, or areas for improvement.
- A score of 1.0 should be reserved for responses that are flawless and could not be improved in any wayâ€”this should be extremely rare.
- A score of 0.5 means the response is adequate but has clear room for improvement.
- Most responses should fall between 0 and 0.8 unless they are truly outstanding.
- Justify your score by referencing specific strengths and weaknesses in the counter-argument.

Format your response as a single JSON object with exactly these keys:
- key='explanation': A concise, critical explanation of your score, citing both strengths and weaknesses.
- key='score': The score as a number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.00, 0.50, 0.79).

### Example:
{{"explanation":"The counter-argument addresses the main point but lacks depth and omits key evidence. Reasoning is mostly sound but could be clearer.","score":0.62}}
